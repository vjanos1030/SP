    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>
      The animated series is not for children. In fact, its goal seems to be to
      offend as many as possible as it presents the adventures of Stan, Kyle,
      Kenny and Cartman. The show has taken on Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden,
      politicians of every stripe and self-important celebrities. Oh, and Kenny
      is killed in many episodes.
